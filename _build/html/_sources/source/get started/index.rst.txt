| Q1. In production environment, the scale of hadoop cluster is
  considerably large, for example, the number of nodes in hadoop cluster
  may reach 1500, so the overhead of staring and stopping the cluster is
  significantly huge. In that case, is BestConfig still applicable?
  Answer: No problem. This just depends on how long you can put up with
  the tuning process. If you can bear a long waiting time, then you can
  use Bestconfig to obtain a best configuration setting. Q2. Can
  BestConfig only be used for software system tuning? Can it also be
  able to tune hardware system? Answer: Now, BestConfig can tune both
  software and hardware systems. Given the set of parameters of
  system（software/hardware）under tune and their valid ranges, then
  BestConfig is able to generate a best configuration setting. Q3. Can
  BestConfig only be used to tune a certain system such as MySQL or
  Hadoop? Is it able to tune other systems such as database systems or
  big data systems.
| Answer: Yes! BestConfig is a general system tuning tool and able to
  tune the widely used systems including MySQL, Tomcat, JVM,
  Hadoop(Hive),Spark, Cassandra, etc. Q4. Is BestConfig tuning process
  based on the online real system and workload? Answer: No, the tuning
  process of BestConfig is run on the staging environment which is a
  mirror of the production environment, using the same actual deployment
  settings (e.g. hardware, clustering, software, etc.). It is mainly for
  a final test, using live data, of the system before production. And,
  implementing the real application workload in the workload generator
  is possible for the system in the staging environment, e.g., by log
  replay. When the tuning process on the staging systems ends, the best
  configuration setting is obtained. Then we apply the best
  configuration setting to the real system. In this way, samples can be
  collected without affecting applications on the real system
  deployment. Q5. The workloads generated by large number of users on
  the online systems are constantly changing. Can the workloads applied
  in the staging environment exactly simulate the real online workloads?
  Answer: The application workloads can be classified into two types.
  One is periodic workload, the other is non-periodic workload. As for
  periodic workload, we can apply log replay to implement the real
  application workload. As for non-periodic workload, we can use
  benchmark to simulate a workload that highly similar to real
  application workload.
