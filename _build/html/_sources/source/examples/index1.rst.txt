======================

Good tools make system performance tuning quicker, easier and cheaper
than if everything is done manually or by experience.

Bestconfig can find better configurations for a specific large-scale
system deployed for a given application workload.

Deployment architecture

Here, “deployment environment” refers to the actual running environment
of your applications, while “staging environment” is some environment
that is almost the same as the deployment environment but where tests
are run without interfering the actual application.

The detailed method of using BestConfig to tune practical system is as
the following, which can be showed by a case of spark tuning.

BestConfig Tuning – Taking Spark as the example SUT

   </h2>

Step 1. Deploy shells scripts for system under tune
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 9 shell scripts in BestConfig and they are classified into two
groups.

   <p>

1. One group consists of 5 shell scripts. They are start.sh, isStart.sh,
   stop.sh, isClosed.sh and terminateSystem.sh and deployed on the
   system under tune.

    The scripts of start.sh and stop.sh deployed on worker and master
   node are different.

   (1) Shell scripts (start.sh and stop.sh) on master node
